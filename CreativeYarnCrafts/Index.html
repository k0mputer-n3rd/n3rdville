          Have you had problems learning to crochet or knit? Are you interested
          in learning new techniques? Do you need a pattern that exactly fits
          your specifications?
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">
          This website is being designed to answer your questions. At present,
          it is still under construction, but the plan is to include all of
          those things and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website is currently under construction. Please forgive the items
          which don&rsquo;t work yet or don&rsquo;t work quite as planned.
          Throughout the website you may encounter notes describing plans for
          future development. This will give you something to look forward to,
          perhaps a reason to visit this site again in the near future.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column middle">
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
          The plan for this website is to include a variety of features.
          Tutorials will be available (free) as PDFs, videos and web pages.
          Several patterns will be available as web pages and free downloads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customized patterns are being worked on for hats, gloves, sweaters and
          socks. Each pattern will take into account the actual gauge of the
          person knitting or crocheting the item, as well as the measurements of
          the person for whom the item is being made. Then the pattern will be
          generated for an exact fit. This will allow the crafter to select the
          yarn and size of needle or hook to be used (within reasonable limits)
          and produce an item exactly to the wearer&rsquo;s specifications. The
          pattern will be emailed to the crafter as a PDF. Videos will be
          available to guide the crafter through the details of the pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another part of the plan is to have the videos mentioned above
          available through YouTube. A presence may also be established for
          other social media sites.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column right">
        <h2>Ideas and Suggestions</h2>
        <p>
          If you have ideas about items you would like to see on this site, you
          are invited to share them. Suggestions for improvement are also
          welcome. The <a href="Contact.html">Contact</a> page has a form for
          giving such feedback. You can also get on the mailing list to receive
          regular updates and be informed when significant upgrades are made to
          this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody&rsquo;s perfect. The first versions of patterns are bound to
          have errors. Please report any errors you find so that they can be
          fixed. Again, the <a href="Contact.html">Contact</a> page will work
          fine for submitting such corrections.
