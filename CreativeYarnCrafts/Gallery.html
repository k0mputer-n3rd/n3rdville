      <p>
        This is my gallery of projects I have done over the years. It is far
        from complete, and I continue to add items to it.

      <h2>Face Mask</h2>
      <p>
        We were all caught off guard by COVID-19. When there was a shortage of
        face masks, I decided it was time to design my own. As I pondered it, I
        imagined working rows horizontally, but I couldn't figure out what to do
        to shape it around the nose. Then I woke up one morning with the idea
        that I could do the rows vertically, starting at the center. The rest of
        the design fell into place after that. The cords are braided to go
        around the ear, with a bead for adjustment to fit almost any head. Since
        crochet has many large holes in the work, it is made to fit with a liner
        of some kind, which can be a paper towel, tissue paper, or even a plain
        white mask. A friend suggested the smile, which I was all too happy to
        add to the design.

      <h2>Granny Squares</h2>
      <p>
        This is a basic granny square, using different colors for each row.
        There are many variations of granny squares, with many different sizes.
        Granny squares are usually stitched togther (with yarn) to make afghans
        (blankets made with yarn, usually knitted or crocheted), but can be used
        to make sweaters and other objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have made many granny square projects over the years, and plan to
        include some of those for which I have pictures.
