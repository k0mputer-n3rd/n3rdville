      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        When I was in third grade, I was visiting my grandmother, who happened
        to be making granny squares. I asked her what she was doing. Rather than
        giving any verbal explanation, she found another crochet hook and
        another skein of yarn, and handed them to me. Then she proceded to show
        me how to make granny squares. From that time on I was "hooked."
      </p>
      <p>
        The next year my mother began teaching me how to knit. Since then she
        has knitted sweaters that have won ribbons at the county fair. I
        couldn't ask for a better instructor.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was in high school, I had the opportunity to take a class in
        Fortran, which is now an archaic programming language. Back then it was
        state of the art, and I gladly accepted the challenge. I took to
        computer programming like a duck to water, and found another passion. I
        eventually obtained a B.S. degree in computer science and worked with
        computers in a variety of capacities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am combining these passions, using my computer skills to create a
        website about knitting and crocheting. I recently decided to expand my
        computer skill set, and signed up for a website design class held by
        <a href="https://bitwiseindustries.com/" target="_blank">
          BitWise Industries
        </a>
        . As a student of BitWise, I am continuing to learn new techniques and
        will be implementing some of them in this website.
