Learning about Websites and Teaching Yarn Crafts

I've been a k0mputer n3rd ever since the days of Fortran and punched cards. I learned to knit and crochet even before that. So when I began taking a class in website design, it naturally followed that my site would be about yarn crafts.

Since I am a student of website design, do not expect great things out of my code. I am doing this so that others in my class can see my code and comment on it.

If you are a visitor to my code or fledgling website, welcome! You will probably learn more about yarn crafts than HTML coding.
